# Stroke-prediction
Predicting stroke in a person based on the various features using seven different machine learning models

Project Description: Predicting the probability of a person suffering stroke based on their age, gender, bmi, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level and smoking_status. Used various ML models to predict and provided the accuracy of these ML models.

Technology: Python

Tools and techniques used: Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn ML models (Linear Regression, K NEarest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), xgboost, metric score evaluation with sklearn
